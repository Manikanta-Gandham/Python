
Following are most common types of NoSQL:

Key-Value Stores: Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. The ‘key’ is an attribute name, which is linked to a ‘value’. Well-known key value stores include Redis, Voldemort and Dynamo.

Document Databases: In these databases data is stored in documents, instead of rows and columns in a table, and these documents are grouped together in collections. Each document can have an entirely different structure. Document databases include the CouchDB and MongoDB.

Wide-Column Databases: Instead of ‘tables,’ in columnar databases we have column families, which are containers for rows. Unlike relational databases, we don’t need to know all the columns up front, and each row doesn’t have to have the same number of columns. Columnar databases are best suited for analyzing large datasets - big names include Cassandra and HBase.

Graph Databases: These databases are used to store data whose relations are best represented in a graph. Data is saved in graph structures with nodes (entities), properties (information about the entities) and lines (connections between the entities). Examples of graph database include Neo4J and InfiniteGraph.
